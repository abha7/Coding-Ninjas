    "Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this \"xxxxx\" with \"x5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9.\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.\n",
    "Output Format:\n",
    "The output contains the string after compression printed in single line.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "0 <= N <= 10^6\n",
    "\n",
    "Where 'N' is the length of the input string.\n",
